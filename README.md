# 👋 Hi, I'm Vuong Quang Tuan

🎓 Final-year Computing Student | 💻 Aspiring Frontend / Backend Web Developer  (.NET / Frontend / Backend)

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a final-year Computing student with a strong focus on **Web Development**, especially using **.NET Framework** and modern web technologies.

Although I haven't completed a formal internship yet, I have solid hands-on experience through **academic projects and self-built applications**, where I worked with **frontend development**, **backend logic**, and **database-driven systems**.

My academic result is **Third-Class Honours**, but I strongly believe that **practical skills, consistency, and problem-solving ability** matter more in real-world software development.  
I am currently seeking an **internship, fresher, or junior role** as a **Web Developer**, where I can continue learning and contribute to real projects.
